## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive backend hardening strategy for the POC-3 payments system. After auditing the current implementation, we've identified several security gaps and areas for improvement across input validation, authentication, authorization, database security, error handling, service resilience, secrets management, and API security.

---

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working Well

#### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**

- ✅ JWT-based authentication implemented across all services
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) middleware in API Gateway
- ✅ Token expiration handling (15m access, 7d refresh)
- ✅ Consistent auth middleware pattern across services
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- ✅ Strong password requirements (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol)

#### 2. **Input Validation**

- ✅ Zod schemas for request validation in auth and profile services
- ✅ Email validation with proper regex
- ✅ Password strength validation with banking-grade requirements
- ✅ Zod error handling in error middleware

#### 3. **Error Handling**

- ✅ Centralized error handling middleware in all services
- ✅ ApiError class for structured errors
- ✅ Consistent error response format
- ✅ Zod validation error handling
- ✅ Proper error logging with Winston
- ✅ Development vs production error detail differentiation

#### 4. **Security Headers & CORS**

- ✅ Helmet middleware for security headers (API Gateway)
- ✅ CORS whitelist with specific origins
- ✅ CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, XSS Protection configured
- ✅ nginx security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)

#### 5. **Observability**

- ✅ Sentry integration (frontend & backend)
- ✅ Structured logging with Winston
- ✅ Prometheus metrics collection
- ✅ Grafana dashboards
- ✅ Request/response logging

## 🚨 Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. **Rate Limiting (CRITICAL)**

**Current State:**

- Rate limits set to 100,000 requests per 15 minutes (intentionally disabled)
- TODO comments indicate original limit was 100 requests
- Auth endpoints should be 5 requests per 15 minutes (currently 100,000)

**Risk:** **HIGH** - System vulnerable to:

- Brute force attacks on login endpoints
- DoS attacks
- API abuse
- Credential stuffing attacks

**Files Affected:**

- `apps/api-gateway/src/middleware/rateLimit.ts`
- `apps/api-gateway/src/config/index.ts`
- `apps/admin-service/src/main.ts` (100,000 limit)
- `apps/profile-service/src/main.ts` (100,000 limit)

### 2. **JWT Security Hardening**

**Current State:**

- No refresh token rotation
- Access tokens valid for 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens valid for 7 days with no rotation
- Default JWT secret: "your-secret-key-change-in-production"
- JWT secret stored as plain text in config

**Risk:** **HIGH** - Vulnerabilities:

- Stolen refresh tokens valid indefinitely until expiration
- Weak default secrets in development can leak to production
- No token revocation mechanism
- No blacklist for compromised tokens

### 3. **Input Validation Gaps**

**Current State:**

- Only auth and profile services have Zod validators
- Payments service lacks input validation
- Admin service lacks input validation
- No sanitization for special characters/SQL injection attempts
- No file upload validation (if applicable)

**Risk:** **MEDIUM-HIGH**

- SQL injection (mitigated by Prisma, but still a concern)
- XSS through unvalidated inputs
- NoSQL injection
- Command injection

**Files Affected:**

- `apps/payments-service/src/controllers/*.ts` (no validators)
- `apps/admin-service/src/controllers/*.ts` (no validators)

### 4. **Secrets Management**

**Current State:**

- JWT secrets have insecure defaults
- All secrets in plain text environment variables
- No encryption at rest for secrets
- No secrets rotation policy
- Database URLs contain credentials in plain text

**Risk:** **HIGH**

- Secrets exposure through logs, error messages, or repository
- No rotation means compromised secrets remain valid
- Default secrets may be used in production

**Files Affected:**

- `.env.example` (contains default secrets)
- All service `config/index.ts` files

### 5. **Database Security**

**Current State:**

- Prisma prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries ✅
- No connection pool limits enforced
- No query timeout configuration
- Query logging enabled in development (could leak sensitive data)
- No encryption at rest mentioned

**Risk:** **MEDIUM**

- Connection pool exhaustion
- Slow query DoS attacks
- Sensitive data in logs

### 6. **Service Resilience**

**Current State:**

- No circuit breakers implemented
- No retry policies for inter-service communication
- Basic timeout on health checks (5 seconds)
- No graceful degradation patterns
- No fallback mechanisms

**Risk:** **MEDIUM**

- Cascading failures
- Service unavailability
- Poor user experience during outages

### 7. **API Response Security**

**Current State:**

- Helmet middleware only on API Gateway
- Other services lack security headers middleware
- No CSP on individual services
- No response sanitization
- Potential information disclosure in error messages

**Risk:** **MEDIUM**

- Information leakage
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Clickjacking

### 8. **Authentication Edge Cases**

**Current State:**

- No account lockout after failed login attempts
- No suspicious activity detection
- No CAPTCHA for repeated failures
- No IP-based restrictions
- No multi-factor authentication (MFA)

**Risk:** **HIGH**

- Brute force attacks
- Credential stuffing
- Account takeover

## Hardening Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes (Week 1) 🔥

#### Priority 1.1: Restore Rate Limiting ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (January 16, 2026)
**Effort:** 2 hours
**Impact:** HIGH
**Commit:** `6dcba56 - security: restore rate limiting to production values`

**Implementation Summary:**

✅ **Completed Tasks:**

1. ✅ Restored original rate limits in API Gateway:
   - General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes (was 100,000)
   - Auth endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes (was 100,000)
2. ✅ Restored rate limits in individual services:
   - Admin Service: 100 requests per 15 minutes (was 100,000)
   - Profile Service: 100 requests per 15 minutes (was 100,000)
3. ✅ Implemented Redis-backed distributed rate limiting
4. ✅ Added RateLimit-* headers (standardHeaders: true)
5. ✅ Custom key generator (IP + User-Agent) for auth endpoints
6. ✅ Health check and metrics endpoint bypass
7. ✅ Graceful Redis connection cleanup on shutdown

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ `apps/api-gateway/src/middleware/rateLimit.ts` - Redis-backed rate limiting
- ✅ `apps/api-gateway/src/config/index.ts` - Restored limits + Redis config
- ✅ `apps/api-gateway/src/main.ts` - Redis cleanup on SIGTERM
- ✅ `apps/admin-service/src/main.ts` - Restored rate limit to 100
- ✅ `apps/profile-service/src/main.ts` - Restored rate limit to 100
- ✅ `package.json` - Added rate-limit-redis@^4.3.1

**Success Criteria Met:**

- ✅ Rate limits enforced on all endpoints
- ✅ Proper 429 responses with Retry-After header
- ✅ Rate limit bypass for health checks
- ✅ RateLimit-Limit, RateLimit-Remaining, RateLimit-Reset headers
- ✅ Redis integration for distributed rate limiting

**Testing Notes:**

- Requires backend services restart to apply changes
- Admin/Profile services enforce limits only in production mode
- Auth rate limit: 5 attempts per 15 min (strict for brute force prevention)
- Redis keys use prefixes: `rl:general:` and `rl:auth:`
- Can reset limits with: `pnpm redis:flush`

---

#### Priority 1.2: JWT Refresh Token Rotation ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (January 16, 2026)
**Effort:** 4 hours
**Impact:** HIGH
**Commit:** `52b7d3d - security: implement JWT refresh token rotation`

**Implementation Summary:**

✅ **Completed Tasks:**

1. ✅ Implemented refresh token rotation:
   - New refresh token generated on each refresh request
   - Old refresh token marked as revoked (not deleted, for audit)
   - Token family tracking for rotation chain
2. ✅ Added token revocation mechanism:
   - Redis-based blacklist for immediate revocation
   - Check blacklist before validating tokens
   - User-level blacklist for password changes
3. ✅ Added token fingerprinting (IP + User-Agent hash)
4. ✅ Implemented session security:
   - Token family tracking detects reuse attacks
   - Auto-revoke all sessions on password change
   - Fingerprint mismatch flags potential token theft

**Database Changes:**

- Added `token_family` - Groups tokens in rotation chain
- Added `fingerprint` - Hash of IP + User-Agent
- Added `is_revoked` - Soft delete for audit trail
- Added `last_used_at` - Track token usage

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ `apps/auth-service/prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated RefreshToken model
- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/services/auth.service.ts` - Token rotation logic
- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts` - Pass request metadata

**New Files:**

- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/services/token-blacklist.service.ts` - Redis blacklist
- ✅ `apps/auth-service/prisma/migrations/20260116140158_add_token_rotation_fields/` - DB migration

**Success Criteria Met:**

- ✅ Refresh tokens rotate on use
- ✅ Old refresh tokens invalid after rotation
- ✅ Token revocation via Redis blacklist
- ✅ Token family tracking detects reuse attacks
- ✅ All sessions invalidated on password change

**BREAKING CHANGE:**

The `/auth/refresh` endpoint now returns BOTH `accessToken` AND `refreshToken`.
Clients MUST update their stored refresh token after each refresh request.

**Response format changed from:**
```json
{ "accessToken": "...", "expiresIn": "15m" }
```

**To:**
```json
{ "accessToken": "...", "refreshToken": "...", "expiresIn": "15m" }
```

**Testing Notes:**

- Existing refresh tokens were deleted (users must re-login)
- Test token rotation by calling /auth/refresh twice with same token (should fail on second)
- Test password change invalidates all sessions

---

#### Priority 1.3: Account Lockout & Brute Force Protection ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (January 16, 2026)
**Effort:** 3 hours
**Impact:** HIGH
**Commit:** `2c0e3f6 - security: implement account lockout and brute force protection`

**Implementation Summary:**

✅ **Completed Tasks:**

1. ✅ Implemented failed login attempt tracking:
   - Track failed attempts by email (hashed) in Redis
   - Lockout after 5 failed attempts within 15-minute window
   - Auto-unlock after 15-minute lockout period expires
2. ✅ Added exponential backoff for repeated failures:
   - Base delay: 1 second
   - Max delay: 60 seconds
   - Formula: baseDelay * 2^(attempts - 2)
3. ✅ Added suspicious activity logging to console (Sentry integration ready)
4. ✅ Added admin endpoints for lockout management

**Deferred (Future Enhancement):**
- CAPTCHA integration (for future, as specified)
- Email notifications for lockouts (for future)

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/services/auth.service.ts` - Integrated brute force protection into login flow
- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts` - Added admin lockout endpoints
- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/routes/auth.ts` - Added admin routes

**New Files:**

- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/services/login-attempts.service.ts` - Core brute force protection logic

**Configuration (Configurable via constants):**

```typescript
const CONFIG = {
  MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS: 5,        // Lockout after 5 failures
  LOCKOUT_DURATION: 15 * 60,     // 15 minutes lockout
  ATTEMPT_WINDOW: 15 * 60,       // 15 minute tracking window
  EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF: true,     // Enable backoff
  BACKOFF_BASE_DELAY: 1,         // 1 second base
  BACKOFF_MAX_DELAY: 60,         // 60 seconds max
};
```

**Success Criteria Met:**

- ✅ Accounts lock after 5 failed attempts
- ✅ Lockout duration is configurable (currently 15 minutes)
- ✅ Admin can unlock accounts via POST /auth/admin/unlock/:email
- ✅ Admin can check lockout status via GET /auth/admin/lockout/:email
- ✅ Suspicious activity logged with IP addresses
- ✅ Exponential backoff between attempts

**API Endpoints Added:**

1. `GET /auth/admin/lockout/:email` - Get lockout status (requires authentication)
   - Returns: isLocked, failedAttempts, lockout details
2. `POST /auth/admin/unlock/:email` - Manually unlock account (requires authentication)
   - Note: Should add ADMIN role check in production

**Security Features:**

- Email addresses are hashed (SHA-256) before storing in Redis keys
- Failed attempts recorded even for non-existent users (prevents enumeration)
- IP addresses tracked (up to 10) for audit purposes
- Warning messages when approaching lockout threshold

**Testing Notes:**

- Requires backend services restart to apply changes
- Test by making 5+ failed login attempts
- Verify lockout message appears on 6th attempt
- Test admin unlock endpoint to clear lockout
- Redis keys use prefixes: `login_attempts:` and `account_lockout:`

#### Priority 1.4: Audit Logging Infrastructure Fix ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (January 16, 2026)
**Effort:** 2 hours
**Impact:** HIGH
**Commits:**
- `0a0ce66 - feat: enable audit logging for login/logout and event subscriptions`
- `dde1439 - fix: update RabbitMQ default credentials to admin:admin`

**Problem Identified:**

The audit logs feature was implemented but not functioning properly due to two issues:
1. RabbitMQ event subscriptions were never started in admin-service
2. Login/logout events were not being published by auth-service

**Implementation Summary:**

✅ **Completed Tasks:**

1. ✅ Initialize RabbitMQ event subscriptions in admin-service:
   - Import and call `startEventSubscriptions()` on server startup
   - Add graceful shutdown with `closeSubscriptions()` on SIGTERM/SIGINT

2. ✅ Add login/logout audit logging:
   - Auth-service now publishes `user.login` event on successful login
   - Auth-service now publishes `user.logout` event on logout
   - Admin-service subscribes to and logs these events

3. ✅ Fix RabbitMQ credentials:
   - Updated default credentials from `guest:guest` to `admin:admin`
   - Matches docker-compose.yml configuration
   - Updated in auth-service, admin-service, and payments-service

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ `apps/admin-service/src/main.ts` - Initialize event subscriptions on startup
- ✅ `apps/admin-service/src/events/subscriber.ts` - Add user.login/logout handlers
- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/services/auth.service.ts` - Publish login/logout events
- ✅ `apps/admin-service/src/config/index.ts` - Fix RabbitMQ URL default
- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/config/index.ts` - Fix RabbitMQ URL default
- ✅ `apps/payments-service/src/config/index.ts` - Fix RabbitMQ URL default

**Audit Events Now Captured:**

| Event | Trigger | Data Captured |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| USER_LOGIN | Successful login | userId, email, loginAt, ipAddress |
| USER_LOGOUT | User logout | userId, logoutAt, email |
| USER_REGISTERED | New user registration | userId, email, role |
| USER_DELETED | User deletion | userId, email |
| USER_UPDATED | Admin updates user | userId, updatedFields |
| USER_ROLE_CHANGED | Role change | userId, newRole |
| USER_STATUS_CHANGED | Status change | userId, isActive |
| PAYMENT_* | Payment events | paymentId, amount, status |

**RabbitMQ Queues Created:**

- `admin_service_user_events` - Subscribes to `user.*` events
- `admin_service_payment_events` - Subscribes to `payment.*` events

**Success Criteria Met:**

- ✅ Login events logged with IP address
- ✅ Logout events logged
- ✅ All user lifecycle events captured
- ✅ Event subscriptions start automatically on admin-service startup
- ✅ Graceful shutdown closes subscriptions properly

**Testing Notes:**

- Requires `.env` file to have correct `RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://admin:admin@localhost:5672`
- Or run with: `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) && pnpm dev:backend`
- Verify queues exist: `curl -s -u admin:admin http://localhost:15672/api/queues | jq -r '.[].name'`
- Check audit logs: Admin MFE → Audit Logs tab

#### Priority 1.5: Payment Events Audit Logging Fix ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (January 17, 2026)
**Effort:** 2 hours
**Impact:** HIGH
**Commits:**
- `d65427a - fix(admin,payments): ensure RabbitMQ connection before event operations`
- `f2a1c4a - feat(admin): show all audit actions in filter dropdown`

**Problem Identified:**

Despite the event subscription infrastructure being set up in Priority 1.4, payment events were still not appearing in audit logs. Investigation revealed:

1. **Root Cause:** RabbitMQ connection race condition
   - The `connection.ts` files used `connectionManager.connect().catch()` which is non-blocking
   - Subscribers and publishers tried to initialize before the connection was established
   - RabbitMQ Management UI showed 0 connections, 0 exchanges, 0 queues

2. **Secondary Issue:** Audit log filter dropdown only showed existing actions
   - `getAvailableActions()` queried database for distinct actions
   - Payment actions didn't appear until events were already logged
   - Users couldn't filter by payment actions before any existed

**Implementation Summary:**

✅ **Completed Tasks:**

1. ✅ Fixed RabbitMQ connection initialization in admin-service:
   - Added `initializeConnection()` function that properly awaits the connection promise
   - Updated `startEventSubscriptions()` to call `initializeConnection()` before subscribing
   - Ensures connection is established before any queue bindings

2. ✅ Fixed RabbitMQ connection initialization in payments-service:
   - Added `initializeConnection()` function (same pattern as admin-service)
   - Added `initializePublisher()` function that awaits connection before initializing publisher
   - Updated `main.ts` to call `initializePublisher()` at startup
   - Added proper shutdown handling with `closePublisher()` and `closeSubscriber()`

3. ✅ Fixed audit log actions dropdown:
   - Changed `getAvailableActions()` to return all known actions from `AUDIT_ACTIONS` constant
   - All 16 audit action types now available in filter dropdown immediately
   - Includes all payment actions: `PAYMENT_CREATED`, `PAYMENT_UPDATED`, `PAYMENT_COMPLETED`, `PAYMENT_FAILED`, `PAYMENT_CANCELLED`

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ `apps/admin-service/src/events/connection.ts` - Added `initializeConnection()` function
- ✅ `apps/admin-service/src/events/subscriber.ts` - Call `initializeConnection()` before subscribing
- ✅ `apps/payments-service/src/events/connection.ts` - Added `initializeConnection()` function
- ✅ `apps/payments-service/src/events/publisher.ts` - Added `initializePublisher()` function
- ✅ `apps/payments-service/src/main.ts` - Initialize publisher at startup, proper shutdown
- ✅ `apps/admin-service/src/services/audit-logs.service.ts` - Return all AUDIT_ACTIONS

**Code Pattern Applied:**

```typescript
// Before (broken - non-blocking connection)
export function getConnectionManager(): RabbitMQConnectionManager {
  if (!connectionManager) {
    connectionManager = new RabbitMQConnectionManager({ ... });
    connectionManager.connect().catch(console.error); // Non-blocking!
  }
  return connectionManager;
}

// After (fixed - properly awaited connection)
let connectionPromise: Promise<void> | null = null;

export async function initializeConnection(): Promise<void> {
  const manager = getConnectionManager();
  if (!connectionPromise) {
    connectionPromise = manager.connect();
  }
  try {
    await connectionPromise; // Properly awaited!
    console.log('[Service] RabbitMQ connection established');
  } catch (error) {
    connectionPromise = null; // Allow retry
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**Success Criteria Met:**

- ✅ RabbitMQ connections established at service startup
- ✅ RabbitMQ Management UI shows 2 connections (admin-service + payments-service)
- ✅ Exchanges and queues properly created and bound
- ✅ Payment events (status changes) now appear in audit logs
- ✅ All 16 audit action types available in filter dropdown
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality

**Testing Notes:**

- After fix, RabbitMQ Management UI (http://localhost:15672) shows:
  - 2 connections (admin-service, payments-service)
  - Exchanges: `user.events`, `payment.events`
  - Queues: `admin_service_user_events`, `admin_service_payment_events`
- Changing payment status in UI triggers event that appears in audit logs
- Filter dropdown shows all actions including payment actions before any logs exist

### Phase 2: Input Validation & Sanitization (Week 2) 🛡️

#### Priority 2.1: Enhanced Validation for Payments Service ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (January 16, 2026)
**Effort:** 4 hours
**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH

The payments service already had Zod validators. This task enhanced them with:

✅ **Completed Tasks:**

1. ✅ Enhanced text sanitization (XSS prevention):
   - Removes HTML tags
   - Removes `javascript:` protocol
   - Removes event handler attributes (`onclick=`, etc.)
   - Trims whitespace
   - Normalizes Unicode (NFC)
   - Removes null bytes

2. ✅ Enhanced amount validation:
   - Minimum: $0.01
   - Maximum: $10,000,000 (prevents overflow/fraud)
   - Positive number validation

3. ✅ Added ISO 4217 currency validation:
   - Validates against 40+ common ISO currency codes
   - Auto-uppercase normalization
   - Rejects invalid currency codes

**New Exports:**

```typescript
// Constants for reuse across services
export { PAYMENT_STATUSES, PAYMENT_TYPES, ISO_4217_CURRENCIES, MAX_PAYMENT_AMOUNT, MIN_PAYMENT_AMOUNT };

// New schemas
export { uuidParamSchema, reportsQuerySchema };
```

**Success Criteria Met:**

- ✅ All payment endpoints validated
- ✅ Invalid requests return 400 with validation details
- ✅ XSS sanitization prevents script injection
- ✅ Amount limits prevent overflow/fraud
- ✅ ISO 4217 currency validation enforced
- ✅ 130 unit tests passing

**Testing Notes:**

- All 130 tests pass in payments-service
- Build compiles successfully
- No regression in existing functionality

#### Priority 2.2: Add Validation to Admin Service ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (January 16, 2026)
**Effort:** 3 hours
**Impact:** MEDIUM

**Implementation Summary:**

Applied same security patterns from Priority 2.1 (payments-service) to admin-service validators.

✅ **Completed Tasks:**

1. ✅ Added XSS sanitization via `sanitizeString()` helper:
   - Removes HTML tags
   - Removes `javascript:` protocol
   - Removes event handler attributes (`onclick=`, etc.)
   - Normalizes unicode (NFC)
   - Removes null bytes

2. ✅ Added `uuidParamSchema` for path parameter validation:
   - All `:id` path params now validated as UUID
   - Prevents injection via malformed IDs

#### Priority 2.3: Enhance Existing Validators ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (January 16, 2026)
**Effort:** 2 hours
**Impact:** MEDIUM

**Implementation Summary:**

Applied consistent security patterns across auth-service and profile-service validators.

✅ **Completed Tasks:**

1. ✅ **Auth Service Enhancements:**
   - Added `sanitizeString()` helper for XSS prevention
   - Added `uuidParamSchema` for `/auth/internal/users/:id` endpoint
   - Added `emailParamSchema` for `/auth/admin/lockout/:email` and `/auth/admin/unlock/:email`
   - Added length limits: email (255), password (255), name (255), refreshToken (2048)
   - Updated controllers to use Zod validation for path parameters

2. ✅ **Profile Service Enhancements:**
   - Added `sanitizeString()` helper for XSS prevention
   - Added phone number format validation (regex pattern)
   - Added timezone validation (IANA format: `America/New_York`, `UTC`)
   - Added language code validation (ISO 639-1 / BCP 47: `en`, `en-US`)
   - Added currency code validation with uppercase transform (ISO 4217)
   - Sanitized fields: address, bio, category
   - Added length limits on all fields

3. ✅ **Unicode Normalization:**
   - All `sanitizeString()` implementations include `.normalize('NFC')`

4. ✅ **Comprehensive Test Suites:**
   - Auth validators: 40+ tests (XSS, UUID, email params, length limits)
   - Profile validators: 30+ tests (phone, timezone, language, currency)

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/validators/auth.validators.ts` - Enhanced validators
- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/validators/auth.validators.spec.ts` - Extended tests
- ✅ `apps/auth-service/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts` - UUID/email validation
- ✅ `apps/profile-service/src/validators/profile.validators.ts` - Enhanced validators
- ✅ `apps/profile-service/src/validators/profile.validators.spec.ts` - New test file

**Decision: No Shared Library**

Instead of creating a shared `libs/backend/validation` library, the `sanitizeString()` helper was duplicated in each service. This approach:
- Avoids cross-service dependencies
- Keeps services independently deployable
- Follows microservices best practices
- Can be refactored to shared lib in future if needed

**Success Criteria Met:**

- ✅ XSS patterns sanitized (HTML tags, javascript:, event handlers)
- ✅ All string inputs normalized (unicode NFC, trimmed)
- ✅ Path traversal prevented via UUID/email validation
- ✅ Comprehensive validation test suites
- ✅ All backend tests passing: auth (105), profile (62), admin (102), payments (130)

   - Created `@payments-system/secrets` library with SecretManager class
   - JWT tokens now include `kid` (key ID) in header to identify signing secret
   - Supports multiple active secrets for graceful rotation
   - Old secrets remain verifiable during grace period
   - Automatic cleanup of old secrets beyond configured keep limit

2. ✅ Created admin endpoints for secret rotation:
   - `GET /auth/admin/secrets/status` - View secrets status (without exposing values)
   - `POST /auth/admin/secrets/rotate` - Rotate JWT/refresh secrets
   - `GET /auth/admin/secrets/rotation-history` - View rotation audit trail
   - `POST /auth/admin/secrets/check-expiring` - Check for expiring secrets

3. ✅ Added secret expiry tracking and warnings:
   - Secrets can have configurable expiry dates
   - Warning callback triggered when secrets near expiry
   - Expired secrets automatically disabled for verification

4. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation:
   - `docs/POC-3-Implementation/SECRETS-ROTATION-GUIDE.md`

```bash
# Legacy (backwards compatible)
JWT_SECRET=your-access-token-secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-token-secret

# Versioned (multiple secrets with key IDs)
JWT_SECRETS='[{"kid":"v2","secret":"new-secret","isActive":true},{"kid":"v1","secret":"old-secret","isActive":false,"canVerify":true}]'
JWT_REFRESH_SECRETS='[{"kid":"refresh-v2","secret":"new-secret","isActive":true}]'

   - Payments Service: port, database, RabbitMQ, Redis
   - Admin Service: port, database, RabbitMQ
   - Profile Service: port, database, Redis, JWT

4. ✅ Production security checks:
   - Blocks insecure default values ('your-secret', 'change-me', 'test-secret', etc.)
   - Requires proper secret configuration (no empty secrets)
   - Validated URL formats for all connection strings

**New Files:**

- ✅ `libs/backend/secrets/src/lib/config-validator.ts` - Core validation logic

// Database URL validation
database: z.object({
  url: postgresUrlSchema.default('postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/auth_db'),
})

// JWT duration validation
jwtExpiresIn: jwtDurationSchema.default('15m')  // Validates '15m', '7d', '1h' format

// URL validation (works with any protocol)
authService: z.object({
  url: urlSchema.default('http://localhost:3001'),  // Validates via URL constructor
})
```

**Insecure Patterns Blocked (Production Only):**

```typescript
const INSECURE_PATTERNS = [
  'change-in-production',
  'change-me',
  'your-secret',
  'default-secret',
  'test-secret',
  'development-only',
  '123456',
];
```

**Success Criteria Met:**

- ✅ All services validate config on startup
- ✅ Clear error messages for invalid config
- ✅ No default insecure values allowed in production
- ✅ All 5 services build successfully
- ✅ All tests passing (auth-service: 107 tests)

- ✅ `20260117052219_add_payment_method_model` (payments-service)

**Environment Variables:**

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64-char hex or 44-char base64 key | Yes (for encryption) |
| `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` | Key identifier for rotation | No (default: 'default') |
| `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_BLIND_INDEX_KEY` | Separate key for blind indexing | No (derived from master) |
| `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_ENABLE_BLIND_INDEX` | Enable blind indexing | No (default: true) |

**Usage Example:**

```typescript
// Generate encryption key
import { generateFieldEncryptionKey } from '@payments-system/db';
const key = generateFieldEncryptionKey();
// Set FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generated key> in .env

// Encryption is automatic via Prisma middleware
// When FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY is set, fields are encrypted on create/update
// and decrypted on read transparently
const profile = await prisma.userProfile.create({
  data: {
    userId: 'user-123',
    phone: '555-1234',      // Automatically encrypted
    address: '123 Main St', // Automatically encrypted
  },
});
// profile.phone returns '555-1234' (decrypted)

// Search by encrypted field using blind index
const found = await prisma.userProfile.findFirst({
  where: { phone: '555-1234' }, // Middleware transforms to phoneIdx search
});
```

**Encrypted Value Format:**

```
$enc$v1$keyId$base64(iv + authTag + ciphertext)
```

- `$enc$` - Prefix identifying encrypted values
- `v1` - Encryption format version (for future upgrades)
- `keyId` - Key identifier for rotation support
- Base64-encoded: 12-byte IV + 16-byte auth tag + encrypted data

**Success Criteria Met:**

- ✅ Sensitive fields encrypted in database with AES-256-GCM
- ✅ Transparent decryption on read via Prisma middleware
- ✅ Key rotation support via key versioning
- ✅ Blind indexing for searchable encrypted fields
- ✅ All backend tests passing (554 tests)

**Testing Notes:**

- Encryption is optional: services work normally without `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- When enabled, log message confirms: "Initializing field encryption with config"
- Existing unencrypted data is returned as-is (backward compatible)
- Generate key: `npx ts-node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`

- ✅ Fallback responses configured
- ✅ Circuit state visible in dashboard (via `/health/circuits` endpoint)

**Implementation Details:**

The resilience library provides a comprehensive circuit breaker solution:

1. **Core Circuit Breaker** (`circuit-breaker.ts`):
   - States: CLOSED (normal), OPEN (fail-fast), HALF_OPEN (testing recovery)
   - Configurable thresholds: error rate (50%), reset timeout (30s), volume threshold (5 requests)
   - Event callbacks: onOpen, onClose, onHalfOpen, onSuccess, onFailure, onTimeout, onReject
   - Statistics tracking: successes, failures, timeouts, rejects, latency percentiles

2. **HTTP Circuit Breaker** (`http-circuit-breaker.ts`):
   - `HttpCircuitBreaker` class with GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE methods
   - Service client registry for health monitoring
   - Automatic fallback on circuit open

3. **Dependency Circuit Breakers** (`dependency-circuit-breaker.ts`):
   - `createDatabaseCircuitBreaker()` - For Prisma/database operations
   - `createRedisCircuitBreaker()` - For Redis cache operations
   - `createRabbitMQCircuitBreaker()` - For RabbitMQ messaging
   - Default timeouts: DB (10s), Redis (3s), RabbitMQ (5s)
   - Health utilities: `getServiceDependenciesHealth()`, `getServiceHealthLevel()`

4. **Prometheus Metrics** (`circuit-metrics.ts`):
   - `circuit_breaker_state` - Gauge (0=closed, 1=half-open, 2=open)
   - `circuit_breaker_requests_total` - Counter
   - `circuit_breaker_successes_total` - Counter
   - `circuit_breaker_failures_total` - Counter

5. **API Gateway Integration**:
   - All proxy routes (auth, payments, admin, profile) protected with circuit breakers
   - Configuration: 50% error threshold, 30s reset timeout, 5 request volume threshold
   - `/health/circuits` endpoint exposes circuit states and stats

**Tests:** 26 unit tests passing for resilience library, 44 tests passing for API gateway

#### Priority 5.2: Retry Policies ✅ COMPLETED

**Effort:** 4 hours
**Impact:** MEDIUM

**Tasks:**

1. ✅ Implement exponential backoff retry:
   - Max retries: 3
   - Initial delay: 100ms
   - Backoff factor: 2x
   - Max delay: 5s
2. ✅ Add retry for idempotent operations only
3. ✅ Add retry budget (prevent retry storms)
4. ✅ Add retry metrics

**New Files:**

- ✅ `libs/backend/resilience/src/lib/retry-policy.ts` - Core retry implementation
- ✅ `libs/backend/resilience/src/lib/retry-policy.spec.ts` - Unit tests (33 tests)

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ Transient failures auto-retry
- ✅ Retry budget prevents storms
- ✅ Metrics track retry success/failure

**Implementation Details:**

The retry policy provides comprehensive retry functionality:

1. **Exponential Backoff Retry** (`withRetry`, `withHttpRetry`):
   - Configurable: maxRetries (3), initialDelayMs (100), backoffFactor (2), maxDelayMs (5000)
   - Jitter added to prevent thundering herd
   - Delay formula: `initialDelay * backoffFactor^(attempt-1)` capped at maxDelay

2. **Idempotent Operation Detection**:
   - Auto-detects idempotency from HTTP method (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE = idempotent)
   - POST and PATCH are non-idempotent by default
   - Explicit override via `isIdempotent` config option
   - Non-idempotent operations are never retried

3. **Retry Budget** (`RetryBudget` class):
   - Prevents retry storms by limiting retry ratio within a time window
   - Default: 20% max retry ratio in 10s window
   - Minimum request threshold before budget applies (default: 10)
   - Per-service budget tracking
   - Auto-cleanup of old entries outside time window

4. **Retryable Error Detection**:
   - Network errors: ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT, ECONNREFUSED, EPIPE, ENOTFOUND, etc.
   - HTTP status codes: 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504
   - Timeout errors detected from error name/message
   - Custom `isRetryable` function support

5. **Prometheus Metrics**:
   - `retry_attempts_total` - Total retry attempts (by service, operation, attempt)
   - `retry_successes_total` - Successful operations (by attempts needed)
   - `retry_failures_total` - Failed operations after all retries
   - `retry_exhausted_total` - Operations where retries were exhausted
   - `retry_budget_exhausted_total` - Retries blocked by budget
   - `retry_attempt_duration_seconds` - Duration histogram per attempt
   - `retry_budget_ratio` - Current budget utilization

6. **RetryPolicy Class**:
   - Reusable policy configuration
   - `execute()` for general operations
   - `executeHttp()` with automatic HTTP method detection
   - Budget stats and reset methods

7. **Service-Level Policies**:
   - `registerServiceRetryPolicy()` - Register per-service policy
   - `getServiceRetryPolicy()` - Retrieve registered policy
   - `getOrCreateServiceRetryPolicy()` - Get or create with defaults

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { withRetry, withHttpRetry, createRetryPolicy } from '@payments-system/resilience';

// Basic retry
const result = await withRetry(
  () => httpClient.get('/api/data'),
  { maxRetries: 3, operationName: 'fetchData', serviceName: 'api-gateway' }
);

// HTTP-aware retry (auto-detects idempotency)
const result = await withHttpRetry(
  () => httpClient.post('/api/payments'),
  { method: 'POST', isIdempotent: true } // Explicitly mark as idempotent
);

// Reusable policy
const policy = createRetryPolicy({ maxRetries: 5, serviceName: 'payments' });
const result = await policy.executeHttp(() => fetch('/api'), 'GET');
```

**Tests:** 33 retry policy tests + 26 circuit breaker tests = 59 total resilience tests passing
