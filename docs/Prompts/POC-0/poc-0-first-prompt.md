I'm ready to start implementing POC-0. Please:

1. Check `docs/POC-0-Implementation/task-list.md` to see the current progress and identify the first task
2. Reference `docs/POC-0-Implementation/implementation-plan.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions
3. Start with Task 1.1: Initialize Nx Workspace

Follow the implementation plan exactly, and update the task-list.md as you complete each task. Remember:

- POC-0 scope only (no backend, routing, state management, auth, Tailwind)
- Production-ready code only (no throw-away code)
- Write tests alongside code
- Follow all rules in .cursorrules

Let's begin!
