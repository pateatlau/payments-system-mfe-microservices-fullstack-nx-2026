I'm ready to start implementing POC-1. Please:

1. Check `docs/POC-1-Implementation/task-list.md` to see the current progress and identify the first task
2. Reference `docs/POC-1-Implementation/implementation-plan.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions
3. Start with Task 1.1: Review and Fix POC-0 Issues

Follow the implementation plan exactly, and update the task-list.md as you complete each task. Remember:

- POC-1 scope only (mock auth, stubbed payments - no actual PSP, no backend)
- Production-ready code only (no throw-away code)
- Write tests alongside code (70% coverage minimum)
- Always use Tailwind CSS v4 syntax (never v3)
- Follow all rules in .cursorrules and `docs/POC-1-Implementation/project-rules-cursor.md`

Let's begin!
